There are so many Undertale fan games, and a lot of them are amazing (recently [Undertale Yellow](https://gamejolt.com/games/UndertaleYellow/136925)), but I think only one of them really expanded on what Undertale was, and I don't know why there aren't more.

<br>

Ok for something to even be considered an Undertale fan game, it isn't really *allowed* to expand too far on the idea, but I'm talking about games clearly inspired by Undertale, but they are actively*trying* to be their own thing.

<br>

In my opinion, when boiling down Undertale to it's bare idea, it was a game that combined bullet hell with RPG, and it had the ability to kill/spare whoever you want, and those choices to kill/spare actually matter and change the game.

<br>

For an Undertale fan game to be an Undertale fan game, I think all you need is 1. the ability to kill/spare anything, and those choices genuinely changing the game, and 2. it needs to be an RPG combined with another genre. I don't even think an Undertale fan game needs to be a bullet hell to be an Undertale fan game. This is the area where I think there could be so much to expand on, yet I've only really seen one game that has tried it, that game being Everhood.

Everhood is an RPG where enemy encounters are not bullet hell, but rather like Guitar Hero, except you *dodge* the incoming notes. This game also has the ability to kill and "spare" every enemy (as far as I remember). When playing this game I feel it is very inspired by Undertale, and I would consider it an Undertale fan game.
