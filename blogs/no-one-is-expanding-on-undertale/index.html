		No One Is Really Expanding On Undertale
	</h1>
	<p>There are so many Undertale fan games, and a lot of them are amazing (recently <a href="https://gamejolt.com/games/UndertaleYellow/136925">Undertale Yellow</a>), but I think only one of them really expanded on what Undertale was, and I don&rsquo;t know why there aren&rsquo;t more.</p>
<br>
<p>In my opinion, when boiling down Undertale to it&rsquo;s bare idea, it was a game that combined bullet hell with RPG, and it had the ability to kill/spare whoever you want, and those choices to kill/spare actually matter and change the game.</p>
<br>
<p>For an Undertale fan game to be an Undertale fan game, I think all you need is 1. the ability to kill/spare anything, and those choices genuinely changing the game, and 2. it needs to be an RPG combined with another genre. I don&rsquo;t even think an Undertale fan game needs to be a bullet hell to be an Undertale fan game. This is the area where I think there could be so much to expand on, yet I&rsquo;ve only really seen one game that has tried it, that game being Everhood.</p>
<br>
<p>Everhood is an RPG where enemy encounters are not bullet hell, but rather like Guitar Hero, except you <em>dodge</em> the incoming notes. This game also has the ability to kill and &ldquo;spare&rdquo; every enemy (as far as I remember). When playing this game I feel it is very inspired by Undertale, and I would consider it an Undertale fan game.</p>
