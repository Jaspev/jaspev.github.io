Just a massive list of sites that I like, no particular order. Contains other site resources / directories, fun websites to play around in, archival sites, literature, tools, sites that I simply think look clean, and artists' sites that I like.

<br>

I'd like to note, click around here at your own risk. I'm ***pretty*** sure (as of making this list, 2024.02.02) all these links are safe. But I'm not going to put too much effort into maintaining this list at all, to be honest. Still will add to it every time I find something cool though.

<br>

Newest things added to the top of their respective categories.
