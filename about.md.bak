Hello! I'm Jaspev. I made the site you're looking at right now. :)
<br>
<br>
I make music, I make games, I make websites, I make samples, I make visuals. I make a lot of stuff. You can see all my work in the nav on the left. 
<br>
<br>
If you wanna [contact]({{< ref "contact" >}}) me for anything, please do!
<br>
<br>
I have a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/k79CPMe3vj) as well, originally made for a [music YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/musicicantfindonyt) I run, which is now used for music events. Do you have an idea for an event that you want to host? [Contact]({{< ref "contact" >}}) me! I'm happy to let anyone run an event for the server.
