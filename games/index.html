<h3 id="pendulum-scrapped">Pendulum (scrapped)</h3>
<p>This is another game that got decently far into development, but never actually finished. It was going to basically be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/891130/SUPER_FLAIL/">SUPER FLAIL</a> except you use your mouse to control the player instead of the keyboard, and money would drop from enemies that you could use to upgrade your flail. The game is somewhat playable, and you can see and download the source code for it on Github <a href="https://github.com/Jaspev/pendulum">here</a> (made in <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot!</a>).</p>

<h3 id="aimbot-tycoon-roblox">Aimbot Tycoon (Roblox)</h3>
<p>A Roblox game where you have to click targets to get money, to buy upgrades for your base. My friend KomradeKat and I did building, and I did programming. <a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/14902237854/Aimbot-Tycoon">Play it here!</a></p>

<h3 id="wunder-scrapped">Wunder (scrapped)</h3>
<p>This game never got finished. It was going to be a non-stop bullet hell that would cycle through enemies every 20 seconds, made with my friend KomradeKat. You can see it&rsquo;s website <a href="../wunder/">here</a>, and listen to it&rsquo;s soundtrack <a href="https://youtu.be/oKjnSqHwTpg">here</a>, and see it&rsquo;s source code <a href="https://github.com/Jaspev/Wunder/">here</a> (made in <a href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot!</a>).</p>
